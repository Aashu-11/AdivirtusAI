As a frontend developer in our fintech company, you are expected to follow a structured and secure development process aligned with financial industry standards. Begin each sprint by reviewing assigned tasks in the project management tool (e.g., Jira) and collaborating with designers and backend developers to clarify requirements and dependencies. Ensure all code follows established UI/UX guidelines, accessibility standards (WCAG), and responsive design principles. Daily commits to version control (Git) with clear, descriptive messages are mandatory. All features must be developed in isolated branches and undergo thorough peer code review before merging to the main branch. Testing (unit and UI) must be conducted prior to deployment using tools like Jest, Cypress, or Playwright, and any sensitive data handling must comply with applicable security standards such as OWASP and PCI-DSS.

Maintain secure coding practices, particularly in authentication flows, data input handling, and financial data display. Ensure seamless integration with APIs by validating inputs/outputs and handling error states gracefully. All UI deployments must pass QA review and be staged before production release. Participate in daily standups, sprint retrospectives, and adhere to all documentation practices, including maintaining up-to-date component libraries and technical notes in the shared knowledge base (e.g., Confluence). Continuous learning is encouragedâ€”stay updated on new frontend technologies, regulatory UI requirements, and contribute to refining the design system and internal best practices regularly.
