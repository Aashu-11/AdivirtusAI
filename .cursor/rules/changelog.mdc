# Changelog Management Rules

## When to Update the Changelog

When instructed with "update changelog", follow these steps:

1. Always add entries to the top of the CHANGELOG.md file under the most recent version:
   ```markdown
   # Changelog
   
   ## [NEW_VERSION] - SPECIFIED_DATE
   
   ### Added
   - New feature 1
   - New feature 2
   
   ## [PREVIOUS_VERSION] - PREVIOUS_DATE
   ```

2. Use the exact date specified by the user:
   ```markdown
   ## [1.1.1] - 2023-10-25  # Use the date mentioned by user
   ```

3. Organize changes into appropriate categories:
   ```markdown
   ### Added
   - New features or capabilities
   
   ### Fixed
   - Bug fixes and error corrections
   
   ### Changed
   - Changes to existing functionality
   
   ### Removed
   - Removed features or capabilities
   
   ### Security
   - Security-related changes
   ```

4. Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
   - MINOR: New features, backward compatible (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
   - PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible (1.1.0 → 1.1.1)

5. Make changelog updates in the same commit as code changes
   - Both code and changelog should reflect the same changes
   - This ensures the changelog accurately represents what's in each version
